					<p>A <b>hydrometer</b> or <b>areometer</b> is an instrument that measures the specific gravity (relative density) of liquids&#x2014;the
						ratio of the density of the liquid to the density of water.</p>
					<p>A hydrometer is usually made of glass, and consists of a cylindrical stem and a bulb weighted with mercury or lead shot
						to make it float upright. The liquid to test is poured into a tall container, often a graduated cylinder, and the hydrometer
						is gently lowered into the liquid until it floats freely. The point at which the surface of the liquid touches the
						stem of the hydrometer correlates to specific gravity. Hydrometers usually contain a scale inside the stem, so that
						the person using it can read specific gravity. A variety of scales exist for different contexts.</p>
					<p>Hydrometers are calibrated for different uses, such as a lactometer for measuring the density (creaminess) of milk,
						a saccharometer for measuring the density of sugar in a liquid, or an alcoholometer for measuring higher levels of
						alcohol in spirits.</p>
					<p>The hydrometer makes use of Archimedes&apos; principle: a solid suspended in a fluid is buoyed by a force equal to the
						weight of the fluid displaced by the submerged part of the suspended solid. The lower the density of the fluid, the
						deeper a hydrometer of a given weight sinks; the stem is calibrated to give a numerical reading.</p>

					<p>An early description of a hydrometer appears in a letter from Synesius of Cyrene to the Greek scholar Hypatia of Alexandria.
						In Synesius&apos; fifteenth letter, he requests Hypatia to make a hydrometer for him. Hypatia is given credit for inventing
						the hydrometer (or hydroscope) in the late 4th century or early 5th century.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>The instrument in question is a cylindrical tube, which has the shape of a flute and is about the same size. It has
							notches in a perpendicular line, by means of which we are able to test the weight of the waters. A cone forms a lid
							at one of the extremities, closely fitted to the tube. The cone and the tube have one base only. This is called the
							baryllium. Whenever you place the tube in water, it remains erect. You can then count the notches at your ease, and
							in this way ascertain the weight of the water.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>According to the <i>Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science</i>, it was used by Ab&#x16B; Rayh&#x101;n al-B&#x12B;r&#x16B;n&#x12B;
						in the 11th century and described by Al-Khazini in the 12th century.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>
					</p>
					<p>It later appeared again in the work of Jacques Alexandre C&#xE9;sar Charles in the 18th century.</p>

					<p>An alcoholmeter is a hydrometer that indicates the alcoholic strength of liquids which are essentially a mixture of
						alcohol and water. It is also known as a proof and Tralles hydrometer (after Johann Georg Tralles, but commonly misspelled
						as <b>traille</b> and <b>tralle</b>). It measures the density of the fluid. Certain assumptions are made to estimate
						the amount of alcohol present in the fluid. Alcoholometers have scales marked with volume percents of &quot;potential
						alcohol&quot;, based on a pre-calculated specific gravity. A higher &quot;potential alcohol&quot; reading on this scale
						is caused by a greater specific gravity, assumed to be caused by the introduction of dissolved sugars. A reading is
						taken before and after fermentation and approximate alcohol content is determined by subtracting the post fermentation
						reading from the pre-fermentation reading.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

					<p>A thermohydrometer is a hydrometer that has a thermometer enclosed in the float section. For measuring the density of

						Very light oils with many volatile components are measured in a variable volume container using a floating piston sampling
						device to minimize light end losses.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</sup>

					<p>A hydrometer analysis is the process by which fine-grained soils, silts and clays, are graded. Hydrometer analysis is
						performed if the grain sizes are too small for sieve analysis. The basis for this test is Stoke&apos;s Law for falling

						the grain in suspension and of the fluid. The grain diameter thus can be calculated from a knowledge of the distance
						and time of fall. The hydrometer also determines the specific gravity (or density) of the suspension, and this enables
						the percentage of particles of a certain equivalent particle diameter to be calculated. <sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>
